Flux Layout
===========

Generates a dynamic responsive CSS grid - any columns, any width - in less than 6k!

Creatives don't like being dicated to or told how many columns their layout has to have or having a whole bunch of other junk CSS that you have to load and overload. Flux layout solves this - it's a fully dynamic responsive layout system with extensive built-in media queries and logically named CSS classes. 

Use either the static CSS version, or the PHP version if you wish to generate your own grid system and media queries. Change on the fly on a per view basis, create and minify your own static CSS file... it's the responsive layout system built to be as flexible as possible!

It includes normalise.css along with a small amount of other general rules (including all WordPress core required CSS) - no other buttons, cruft or junk to clutter up your files. Lean and mean - if you minify the file & enable server compression you can get it down to less than 6k - light enough for you?!

Flux Layout has been developed as part of the free, Open Source Wonderflux Theme Framework for WordPress - http://wonderflux.com

NOTE: This project is in a flux of development (appologies for the corny joke!) - so all suggestions/bug swattings welcome! In it's current form it's fully functional without bugs and has gone through extensive testing.
